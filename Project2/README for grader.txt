This project was created by Cory Singer and Ray Beecham

This is project 2

The way the ADD BUTTON functions is by placing your name
in the textbox next to Name: such as "Tony Smith", and then placing 
your Drink in the drink textbox named Drink: such as "Expresso"
You will then click add order in which your details along with your 
order ID will be generated.

You may also GET orders from the restlet client by
using the get button, but will need to place the following endpoint
http://rest.learncode.academy/api/:csing/:testing.

You will need to place the Order ID obtained from adding in order into 
the Order ID textbox in order to DELETE or EDIT an order and then 
clicking the button corresponding to what you are desiring.

We had issues with the Chrome's CORS policy, so we need you to use 
FireFox. It does work for us on our own machines and
if you copy the code and use it on your local machine
then it will work but we are having security issues
when using it on schools machines or another computer.

Lastly, Cory and I can be reached by our emails on the footer of the page
if you have any additional questions or problems.
